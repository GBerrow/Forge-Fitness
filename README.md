**Importance**

Maintaining daily physical activity is crucial for achieving fitness goals and overall health. 
Regular movement, such as walking, climbing stairs, or engaging in light exercises, complements 
structured workouts by enhancing cardiovascular health, 
improving endurance, and aiding in weight management. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), regular physical activity contributes to the prevention 
and management of noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes, 
and also reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety.

While specific percentages on accelerated goal achievement due to daily activity vary 
among individuals and depend on factors like baseline fitness levels and overall lifestyle, 
the consensus is clear: integrating consistent daily activity with your fitness regimen 
significantly enhances the likelihood of reaching and maintaining your health objectives. 
Therefore, focusing on daily movement is a practical and effective strategy to support your fitness journey.

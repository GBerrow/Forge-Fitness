## Database Tables  

### 1. **User Table**  
**Purpose:** Stores user account details required for **authentication and profile personalization**.  

#### **Key Fields:**  
- `user_id` **(Primary Key, Auto-increment)** – Unique identifier for each user.  
- `first_name` **(VARCHAR)** – Stores the user’s first name.  
- `last_name` **(VARCHAR)** – Stores the user’s last name.  
- `email` **(VARCHAR, Unique)** – Used for login authentication.  
- `password_hash` **(TEXT)** – Securely stored hashed password for authentication.  
- `profile_picture` **(VARCHAR, Nullable)** – Stores the file path of the user’s uploaded profile picture.  
- `bio` **(TEXT, Nullable)** – Stores the user’s bio from the profile page.  
- `created_at` **(TIMESTAMP)** – Tracks when the user account was created.  

#### **How It Works:**  
- This table is **central to the application**, storing **all necessary user details** for authentication and profile management.  
- Ensures **secure login and data retrieval**, linking to the **Settings Table** for additional account controls.  

---

### 2. **Settings Table**  
**Purpose:** Stores **basic user account settings** related to **account status management**.  

#### **Key Fields:**  
- `user_id` **(Foreign Key, References User Table)** – Links settings to the corresponding user.  
- `account_status` **(ENUM('active', 'deactivated'))** – Indicates whether an account is **active or has been deleted**.  

#### **How It Works:**  
- This table helps manage **account activation and deactivation**, ensuring a simple way to **handle user status** without unnecessary complexity.  
- Linked to the **User Table** through `user_id`, ensuring **every user has an associated settings entry**.

## **How It All Works Together**  

### **User Authentication & Profile Management**  
✅ The **User Table** handles **login credentials, profile details, and user registration**.  
✅ Users can **upload a profile picture and add a bio** to personalize their profile page.  

### **Account Management**  
✅ The **Settings Table** allows users to **delete or deactivate their account**, ensuring a minimal but effective approach to **user preferences**.

## Folder Structure

The Forge Fitness project follows a modular and structured approach to maintain scalability, clarity, and maintainability. This refactored structure ensures that user authentication, profile management, and settings are well-organized while keeping the core Django project structure intact.

### 🔹 How It’s Organized  

✔ **User authentication & profile management** are handled in the `users/` directory.  
✔ **User settings & account preferences** are managed in the `settings/` directory.  
✔ **Core Django settings, static assets, and templates** are stored in the `forge_fitness/` directory.  
✔ **Project-wide assets**, including wireframes and diagrams, are contained in the `assets/` directory.  


![Folder Structure](assets/wireframes/folder_structure.png)

Each directory corresponds to a specific feature or functionality of the application:

1. **Root Directory (`forge-fitness/`)**  
   - Contains project-wide configurations such as:  
     - `manage.py` – Django project management script.  
     - `requirements.txt` – Dependencies and package requirements.  
     - `.env` – Environment variables for database credentials and secrets.  

2. **Main Application (`forge_fitness/`)**  
   - Manages the core Django project settings, including:  
     - `settings.py` – Configuration for installed apps, middleware, database settings.  
     - `urls.py` – Central URL routing for the project.  
     - `wsgi.py` & `asgi.py` – Deployment configurations.  
   - Contains **static files (`static/`)** used across the entire project.  
   - Stores **global templates (`templates/`)**, including:  
     - `base.html` – Layout foundation for all pages.  
     - `navbar.html` – Shared navigation bar.

   - Contains:  
     - `models.py` – User database schema (storing login credentials, profile details).  
     - `views.py` – Handles authentication workflows (signup, login, profile updates).  
     - `forms.py` – Form handling for user authentication.  
   - Templates include:  
     - `signup.html` – User registration page.  
     - `login.html` – Login interface.  
     - `profile.html` – User profile settings.  

4. **Settings Module (`settings/`)**

### 🔹 How It Ties Into the Database  

The **folder structure** directly reflects the **database schema**, ensuring a **one-to-one mapping between functionalities and data storage**:

- The **`users/` app** aligns with the **User Table**, managing authentication and profile data.  
- The **`settings/` app** links to the **Settings Table**, handling user preferences.  

By **maintaining this structured relationship**, the project ensures a **seamless flow of data** between the backend and frontend, making it easier to **scale and manage future enhancements**.

##  Initial Design

 The color scheme I have gone for is a combination of light colours to create a clean and modern look. The colours I have gone for are:

Header: BCCCDC - Light Blue

![Colour Scheme](<assets/images/colour-scheme/header-colour .png>)

Body: ECECEC - Light Grey

![Colour Scheme](assets/images/colour-scheme/body-colour.png)

Footer: AAB2C1 - Dark Grey

![Colour Scheme](assets/images/colour-scheme/footer-colour.png)

The typography is yet to be decided. But I want the layout of the website to be designed easy to read and visually appealing, with a focus on using a font that is both readable and visually appealing. 

## User Experience (UX) and wireframes

To create a top class fitness app, this website is being desinged with a great amount of care and attention to detail. In the Dashboard page, I have included a variety of features to help users create their own workout regimes and track their progress tailored to their fitness goals. Here are the main features down below:

## Dashboard
